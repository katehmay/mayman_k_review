# Web 2 week 1 - Workflow and Editor Review and Setup
### We learned some awesome stuff in one day! Apparently more than almost an entire semester! I'm keeping this bit in because it is, quite frankly, the truth.

Re-learning how to write HTML with Emmet, configuring Sublime Text / Atom, working with Git and Github (and the Git bash)

Tools Used:
HTML
CSS
